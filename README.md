Palindromic numbers are fun! I ported this over to Xcode to play with them. 

Usage:
__________________________________________________________
bpal.c -- reverse and add palindromes 


   usage| >bpal
       user prompted for:|
|       -starting number
|      -range
|       -number of iterations
__________________________________________________________
   output to console and to the file palin.txt
   palin.txt is overwritten each run
