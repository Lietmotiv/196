Palindromic numbers are fun! I ported this over to Xcode to play with them. 
bpal.c -- reverse and add palindromes 
Usage:




   usage| >bpal
       user prompted for:
       
      -starting number
      
      -range
      
      -number of iterations
      
   output to console and to the file palin.txt

   palin.txt is overwritten each run
